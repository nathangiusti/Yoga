## Overview

Tadasana is widely considered the base pose for yoga. It is almost identical to the standard anatomical position. The only difference is optional. Some choose to rotate their palms to face forward, otherwise the palms may be kept turned towards the thigh. 

Feet can be places together or hips width distance apart. Closer together encourages balance but may not be possible for all anatomically.
